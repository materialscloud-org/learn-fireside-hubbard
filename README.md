# learn-fireside-hubbard

This is a tutorial for density-functional theory (DFT) with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+U+V) where U and V are on-site and inter-site Hubbard parameters. The DFT+U+V tutorial is based on the open-source [Quantum ESPRESSO distribution](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) (QE)[1,2].

Quantum ESPRESSO is already installed in the Quantum Mobile (see below), a virtual machine (VM) that can run on any Windows, Mac, or Linux laptop/desktop.

# Using the Quantum Mobile Virtual Machine

The setup of the Quantum Mobile requires you to download the [Quantum Mobile image](https://github.com/marvel-nccr/quantum-mobile/releases/) (we use the v21.06.04 release) and the open-source Virtual Box (VBox) virtualizaton software. See the [Instructions.pdf](https://github.com/materialscloud-org/learn-fireside-hubbard/blob/main/Instructions.pdf) on how to setup the Quantum Mobile on your computer.

# Exercises

See the [Tutorial.pdf](https://github.com/materialscloud-org/learn-fireside-hubbard/blob/main/Tutorial.pdf) on how to do the exercises which are isted below:

 - [Exercise 1](1_DFT): Standard DFT calculation for CoO
 - [Exercise 2](2_Hubbard_parameters): Calculation of Hubbard parameters for CoO
 - [Exercise 3](2_DFT+U+V): DFT+U+V calculation for CoO
