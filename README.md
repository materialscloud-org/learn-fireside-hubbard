# learn-fireside-hubbard

This is a tutorial on how to use density-functional theory (DFT) with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+U+V), where U and V are on-site and inter-site Hubbard parameters. It is based on the open-source [Quantum ESPRESSO distribution](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) [1,2].

Quantum ESPRESSO (v6.7) is installed in the Quantum Mobile - a virtual machine that can run on Windows, MacOS, or Linux.

# Using the Quantum Mobile Virtual Machine

See the [Instructions.pdf](https://github.com/materialscloud-org/learn-fireside-hubbard/blob/main/Instructions.pdf) on how to setup the Quantum Mobile on your computer. (Note: the hyperlinks in the file [Instructions.pdf](https://github.com/materialscloud-org/learn-fireside-hubbard/blob/main/Instructions.pdf) work only when you download this file and open it on your computer.)

# Exercises
